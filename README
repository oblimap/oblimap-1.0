To compile the OBLIMAP source:

 Check which fortran compiler you are using. In the Makefile default the
  
  Makefile.pgf90
 
 is included, however also one of below can be included:
  Makefile.g95
  Makefile.gfortran
  Makefile.mpfort
 
 In the Makefile.* one should check the NETCDF path, in our default it is:
  
  NETCDF_DIR = /usr/local
 
 After these checks / addaptions you can compile the OBLIMAP source by
 
  cd src/
  make all
  
 To run:
 
  cd ../
  ./oblimap_to_and_fro_mapping.csh
  
 or with specifying a CONFIG file:
  
  ./oblimap_to_and_fro_mapping.csh CONFIGs/CONFIG_mapped_ccsm_Greenland
